1. Use the sample provided along with questions to answer the following questions.

a) The sample is obfuscated or packed using some technique. Identify which
obfuscation or packing technique has been applied to the sample and describe how
you discovered the technique used. Also, deobfuscate/unpack the sample for
answering the remaining questions.

    Packer, UPX(3.91)[NRV,best]
    
    signature,Microsoft Visual C++ vx.x DLL
    file-type,dynamic-link-library

    I used PEstudio and detect it easy tool to identify the obfuscation technique.


b) The malware sample infects a specific desktop application. See if you can identify
the target application of the malware by analysing the sample. Justify your answer
with evidence/information obtained from the analysis.

   msg.gsm is a filename specfied along with the function calls, so it must be 
   the desktop application that is being targeted.

c) The sample possibly stores some data in a database on the infected machine. Can
you identify which database application/engine is used to store the data? Justify
your answer with evidence/information obtained by analysing the malware.


    It uses the windows registry database system to store data, as PEstudio shows that
    the file references the Registry API,5 and also it used the following functions 
    and libraries.

    RegCloseKey function from advapi32.dll

    advapi32 - Advanced Windows 32 Base API


d) Other analysts feel that the malware sends out HTTP requests and receives HTTP
responses from a remote server. Identify the Windows API functions imported by
the sample that support this hypothesis.

    InternetOpenA() from wininet.dll - Internet Extensions for Win32


e) A user agent string is a string included in request headers by HTTP clients(eg: web
browsers) to identify the software being used by the client. The provided sample
uses a specific browser user agent string to possibly masquerade as a web browser.
Identify which browser agent string used by the sample.

    Mozilla/4.0 


f) During dynamic analysis, you will observe outgoing data from the malware
exchanged over the network. Since the sample possibly sends out HTTP requests,
can you identify
